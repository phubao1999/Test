                        Programme Manager

                    </h5>
                    <h5 class="mt-5">How long have you been working at The George Institute?</h5>
                    <p>Since October 2018.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">What is your professional background?</h5>
                    <p>The unifying theme of my work has been supporting women’s public health. I have done this in a
                        wide variety of settings, ranging from government to hospitals to a small Bolivian
                        non-governmental organisation. <br> <br> I have a Master’s degree in epidemiology, and I like to
                        inform my data analyses with an understanding of the patient experience. Because of this, my
                        professional background has balanced quantitative analysis with community-facing public health
                        work. For example, as a city research scientist at the New York City Department of Health and
                        Mental Hygiene, I created a near real-time surveillance system for monitoring cases of intimate
                        partner violence in emergency departments across the city. Both before and during my time
                        working at the health department, I also volunteered with a sexual and domestic violence crisis
                        programme, where I worked one-on-one with patients seeking emergency care to provide mental
                        health counselling, safety planning, and referral services. Holding these two positions in
                        parallel allowed me to use the patient perspective to meet broader, population-level needs.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">
                        What attracted you to working at The George Institute?
                    </h5>
                    <p>The George Institute’s mission to assess and develop innovative health services, especially in
                        countries and communities where such services are limited, really resonates with me. Also, as
                        someone with a strong interest in social entrepreneurship, I especially like how being based in
                        Oxford simultaneously provides the opportunity to work at a university steeped in tradition with
                        the Institute’s enterprising approach to tackling health challenges.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">
                        What are you currently working on?
                    </h5>
                    <p>I split my time between two roles - managing The George Institute for Global Health UK <a href=""
                            style="color: #870082"> Women’s Health programme, </a>and partaking in some of the research
                        that falls under this stream. <br> <br> On the managerial side of things, my main objective is
                        to form interdisciplinary partnerships, both within the University of Oxford and externally,
                        that will help advance the goals and reputation of our new global women’s health initiative. I
                        also provide support (literature reviews, landscape scoping, etc.) to support funding
                        applications, and manage the logistics of research meetings and collaboratives. On the research
                        end of my job, I work with <a href="" style="color: #870082"> Elizabeth Millett, Sanne
                            Peters,</a> and <a href="" style="color: #870082"> Mark Woodward</a> on conducting
                        sex-disaggregated data analysis with the goal of identifying sex and gender differences in
                        chronic disease risk factors and outcomes.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">
                        What is a recent highlight?
                    </h5>
                    <p>I really enjoy the partnership-building aspect of my managerial role, which allows me to meet
                        incredible leaders in the field of women’s health! For example, as part of our work developing
                        the jointly launched WHO/The George Institute Women and NCDs community of practice, Emma Feeny
                        and I recently met with the first female surgeon of Sudan, Nahid Toubia, who after a long career
                        as an advocate against female genital mutilation is now Director of the Institute for
                        Reproductive Health & Rights in Khartoum.</p>
